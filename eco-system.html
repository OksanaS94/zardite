						'Videogames are for kids.' 'Videogames are for boys.' 'Videogames are violent.' These are just
						some of the stereotypes which colour how we think about and interact with videogames. But
						disruption has begun. A wave of cultural voices, spanning writers, designers, players and
						commentators, is challenging how we talk about videogames, questioning and pushing back against
						some of the stereotypes. Through games, YouTube videos and writings, these disruptors are
						confronting controversial subjects head-on and exploring the mediumss power to impact our
						thought systems and politics. Ultimately our society. The disruptive voices bring sensitivity
						and nuance to complex issues. But although critically praised, many face strong and at times
						negative reactions. Some find their work banned from leading platforms, while others are
						subjected to campaigns of online harassment. Yet, their efforts have had huge impact and
						continue to broaden and deepen vital conversations.
